## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For forms

### What I learned

While making this web application I have practised my react skills, especially react hooks such as useContext and useReducer. They allowed me to avoid prop drilling and make the state management more structured. I have also learned how to deal with forms in react and used the React Hook Form library to make this process faster and easier.

### Continued development

While react hooks provide great possibility for managing state in small to medium size project, Redux is used by a lot of developers in large application so I will definetely try to use it in my next project. I am also planning to learn the Next.js framework for SSG and SSR purposes.
